 ansible-playbook webserver.yml --ask-become-pass
 ------------------------------------------------

 
ansible-playbook: This is the Ansible command used to run a playbook. A playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to automate configuration or deployment on one or more remote machines.

webserver.yml: This is the name of the playbook file you want to run. Usually, this file contains tasks related to installing, configuring, or managing a web server (like Apache or Nginx).

--ask-become-pass: This option tells Ansible to prompt you for the sudo (or privilege escalation) password. It is needed if the tasks in the playbook require elevated privileges on the target machines (for example, installing software or modifying system files).

Finally website got hosted in localhost
